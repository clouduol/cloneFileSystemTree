# cloneFileSystemTree
Windows batch file for cloning file system tree
## cloneCompleteFileSystemTree.bat
This windows batch file will clone complete file system tree of your windows. However, it may be very slow.  
You can change variables cloneRootDirectory and cloneRootDirectory2 to decide where to store file system tree.
## CAUTION
These batch files are UNIX format line endings, that is , LF.  
However, if you want to run it on your windows system, you should convert it to WINDOWS format, that is , CRLF.  
Or for simplicity, create a new file on windows, and copy the content into the file.
