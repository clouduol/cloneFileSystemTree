# cloneFileSystemTree
Windows batch file for cloning file system tree
## cloneCFST_for-statement.bat
This windows batch file will clone complete file system tree of your windows using for statement.      
However, it may be very slow, sometimes 4~5 hours.   
You can change variables cloneRootDirectory and cloneRootDirectory2 to decide where to store file system tree.  
If this batch file work failed with strange errors on your windows, it may be the reason of **line endings**, just change UNIX format to WINDOWS or copy the content to a new batch file and run again.
